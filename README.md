# Idiots-hash

Etremely stupid hash function written by man-kind :)

It works sometimes really well thu ğŸ˜†ğŸ˜†

Ah Almost forgot... results depends on the machine and the compiler ğŸ˜†ğŸ˜†ğŸ˜†ğŸ˜†ğŸ˜†ğŸ˜†ğŸ˜†ğŸ˜†ğŸ˜†ğŸ˜†ğŸ˜†ğŸ˜†

the worst thing is that it worked better than DJB2 and MurmurHash3 on my machine ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£

# how to build
make sure you have `gcc` installed it might work with `clang` but haven't test it because it must remian the worst string hashing program
and it wouldn't be that way if it was portable ğŸ¤£


clone the repository first then build by running this script

```
sh compile.sh
```

run the program with the executable file you get
